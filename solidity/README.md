# BlockFid Audits – Solidity

Welcome to **BlockFid’s Audits** repository, where we host and maintain **Solidity-based smart contract security reviews**. Our goal is to foster transparency and trust within the blockchain ecosystem by openly sharing our findings and best practices.

## Overview

- **Name**: BlockFid Audits (Solidity)  
- **Purpose**: Provide detailed reports of smart contract audits, covering security assessments, code quality checks, and recommendations for improvements.  
- **Scope**: ERC-20 tokens, DeFi protocols, NFT contracts, governance systems, and other Solidity-based projects.
