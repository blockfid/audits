# MiaoTheCat Audit

This folder contains the **MiaoTheCat** token audit conducted by **BlockFid**. MiaoTheCat is a meme-inspired ERC-20 token that implements a **locked-transfer mechanism** to manage early liquidity and potential market volatility.

---

## Overview

- **Token Name**: Miao The Cat  
- **Symbol**: MIAO  
- **Contract Address**: `0xa318Fe1f17e86511Ba09CF4A75B950BF040d8F79` *(Replace with the actual address)*  
- **Overall Security Score**: **88/100**  

The audit covered **core ERC-20 logic**, **ownership privileges**, **supply cap enforcement**, and the **locked-transfer mechanism** (`_secureTransferFlags`). Our findings and recommendations aim to help the MiaoTheCat team maintain a secure, transparent, and user-friendly token ecosystem.

## Key Findings

1. **No Critical or High-Severity Vulnerabilities**  
   - No immediate exploits or re-entrancy concerns discovered.  
   - Minting logic adheres to the supply cap; no infinite mint scenarios detected.

2. **Medium-Risk: Locked-Transfer Mechanism**  
   - Certain addresses can bypass the sell lock if flagged with `_secureTransferFlags == 1`.  
   - Introduces **centralization** concerns if not managed transparently.  
   - Recommended to implement **multisig** governance for flag updates and clearly communicate changes to the community.

3. **General Code Quality**  
   - Code is well-structured and documented, using **SafeMath** for older Solidity versions.  
   - Potential improvements include more modularization and consistent naming conventions.

## Audit Documents

- **[MiaoTheCat-Audit-Report.pdf](./MiaoTheCat-Audit-Report.pdf)** *(or Markdown link)*  
  Contains the detailed analysis, methodology, findings, and recommendations.

- **Supplementary Materials**  
  - Code snippets illustrating critical logic (e.g., `_secureTransferFlags`, `sellLockExpiration`).  
  - Risk matrix and severity definitions.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Flag Governance**  
   - Adopt a **multisig** or DAO-based approach to updating `_secureTransferFlags`.  
   - Publish a list of flagged addresses and changes to foster community trust.

2. **Clear Communication**  
   - Document the purpose and duration of the **sell lock** so users understand why some transfers are restricted.

3. **Ongoing Security**  
   - Schedule **periodic re-audits** or internal reviews, especially if you add new features (e.g., bridging, advanced governance).  
   - Consider a **bug bounty** program to incentivize external security researchers.

## Score Justification (88/100)

- **Robust Foundations (40 points)**  
  - Proper ownership structure, supply cap enforcement, and code clarity.

- **No Critical/High Issues (30 points)**  
  - No vulnerabilities discovered that would result in immediate fund loss or contract failure.

- **Medium Risk Issue (15 points deducted)**  
  - Locked-transfer design could hinder user operations or liquidity if misused.

- **Best Practices & Documentation (15 points)**  
  - Code is well-commented and mostly follows standard conventions. Additional points could be gained by fully decentralizing `_secureTransferFlags` management.

*(Scoring is subjective and based on a combination of code review, risk assessment, and best-practice adherence.)*
